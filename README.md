My Emacs Configuration
======================

This time around I will set stuff up with Cask.


Requirements
------------

  * Emacs 24+
  * Cask https://github.com/cask/cask


Installation
------------

Use Git to clone the repo into ~/.emacs.d and install the dependencies using `cask install` in the newly cloned folder.
