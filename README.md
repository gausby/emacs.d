My Emacs Configuration
======================

This time around I will set stuff up with Cask.

 * I have been looking at the [Emacs configuration](https://github.com/tonini/emacs.d/) by [Samuel Tonini](https://github.com/tonini), and some parts of his config has been lifted into this one.

 * Some bits has been taken from [Bozhidar Batsov](https://github.com/bbatsov)'s [Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) starter package.

Requirements
-------------

  * Emacs 24+
  * [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) for handling dependencies


Installation
------------
### Fetch dependencies
Use Git to clone the repo into ~/.emacs.d and install the dependencies using `cask install` in the newly cloned folder.

Some dependencies are installed using git submodules, these can be initialized by typing `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update`.

### Fonts
The font I use is [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) from Adobe. Follow the install instructions for your operating system.

unicode-fonts require the following fonts to be installed on the system:

  * [DejaVu Sans and DejaVu Sans Mono][dejavu]
  * [Quivira][quivira]
  * [Noto Sans and Noto Sans Symbol][noto]
  * [Symbola][symbola] by George Douros

[dejavu]: http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download
[quivira]: http://www.quivira-font.com/downloads.php
[noto]: http://www.google.com/get/noto/
[symbola]: http://www.fontspace.com/unicode-fonts-for-ancient-scripts/symbola

### Elixir
The setup require emacs-elixir and alchemist.el to be cloned into the *~/Development/forks*-directory. I have some clones going there but the official repos might work just as wellâ€”or even better.

### Calendar and Diary
Calendar needs a diary file. Write `touch ~/.diary` in the terminal to generate one.

The calendar location is set to Copenhagen, Denmark.

### Gist
Create a token on github and add the following to your *~/.gitconfig*

```config
[github]
    user = *GITHUB_USER_NAME*
    oauth-token = *TOKEN*
```

Replace *GITHUB_USER_NAME* and *TOKEN* with the appropriate values.
